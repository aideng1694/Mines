                Rhymines is a web port of a Minesweeper clone that Rhymu8354
                originally wrote in C++ and assembly for MS-DOS in 1992.
                Some of the original source code was lost, so he decided to
                rewrite it for the web, using the original artwork, level
                parameters, and special ability designs.
